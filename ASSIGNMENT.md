1. Verify project. See README.md for more details.  

2. Next, we want to improve this tool by adding a filter to only certain files. 
For example, to only print .dcm files. Add this feature to the code. 

2. TODO(ILIAS): Some devopsish task.

The bucket only contains folders. These folders only contain files. 

DICOM folder is defined as: 
* One and only one text file (.txt). 
* At least two dicom files (.dcm). 

3. Change the code such that only the files inside dicom folders are printed. 
You don't have to write tests for this feature.
